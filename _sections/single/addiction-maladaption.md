## Addiction is an <span class="emphasized-header">maladaptation</span> to an unhealthy social environment.
{:class="two-lines bottommargin"}

Even more than our primate cousins, homo sapiens have complex genetic and neurochemical factors that incentivize social connection. We have an evolutionary advantage for social behavior, social connection, and forming group bonds in order to survive and build civilizations and complex social structures. Thereâ€™s a lot of complex neurochemistry happening to drive those behaviors, and

**opioid compounds specifically are implicated in the neurochemistry of human social bonding.**

It turns out that naturally-occurring opioid compounds are intricately involved in the reward systems our brains use to reinforce social connection. These naturally occurring opioids make social connection literally feel good: in a part of the brain called the striatum.
