# The SeekHealing project implements <span class="emphasized-header">creative ideas</span> that turn the traditional rehab model <span class="emphasized-header">upside-down</span>

Our facilities &amp; programs are intentionally designed to enhance an individualâ€™s experience of connectedness, rather than diagnosing &amp; treating specific problems.

We believe that using the label *addict* facilitates socially-acceptable shaming. Stigmatizing people as addicts and creating non-addict/addict relationships in therapeutic settings often worsens the roots causes of addiction: isolation and disconnectedness.
