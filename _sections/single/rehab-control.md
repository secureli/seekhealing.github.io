# The modern opioid addiction crisis is <span class="emphasized-header">[out of control.](/why-we-care/)</span>

The people we love who are recovering from opiate or heroin bonds have a limited set of options for their post-detox life, and often even fewer resources available to create and follow plans that lead to sustainable health. Most return to the dysfunctional environments they came from, or find their way into rehab facilities, halfway houses and prisons where they feel lonelier than ever.
