# About <span class="emphasized-header">SeekHealing</span>

Healthy relationships are proven to be [the number one factor in relapse prevention](/science-of-connection/). For many different reasons, modern life has made these types of connections harder and harder to find — especially for those who find themselves outcasted for mental health issues and self-destructive addiction behaviors.

Whether you struggle with a chemical addiction or not, the medicine of authentic connection is something we all need.
