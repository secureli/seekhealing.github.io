- <span class="bold">Public harm reduction education</span>: training in overdose reversal and redefining addiction
- <span class="bold">Open door policy</span>: current drug users, abstinence-only, & medication-assisted treatment all welcome
- <span class="bold">Ongoing support</span>: pairing with trained volunteers, community activities, & therapeutic services
- <span class="bold">Training in authentic connection</span>: how to better listen to others and yourself
- <span class="bold">Community re-integration</span>: see “How SeekHealing Works”
