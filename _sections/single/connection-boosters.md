Things like hiking, yoga, foraging, meditation, martial arts, dance, aerial arts, gardening, horseback riding, painting, animal healing touch, Reiki, 12 step groups, alternative recovery groups, slacklining, sports leagues, and more.

SeekHealing will cover any fees associated with getting signed up for these things and our program management team will work with you to schedule. We’ll also have a conversation with you about what you do and don’t like, so you’re not obligated to continue doing any one activity. The point is to explore and find something you like and that helps you feel really connected.
