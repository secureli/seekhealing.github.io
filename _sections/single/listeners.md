# <span class="emphasized-header">Volunteer to Listen</span>

Join our community and sign up for <a href="/listening-training/">Listening Training</a> today. After training, you’ll be paired with another person in the Asheville, NC community for a high-impact volunteering opportunity that asks you to meet in person once a week to practice deliberate, authentic human connection. The SeekHealing community includes folks at all stages in the addiction healing process; some of whom are at risk for overdose and enrolled in our Extra Care Program (link). No matter who you’re paired with, you will be part of treating addiction at a societal level in Western North Carolina and helping to build a community that is inherently resilient to addiction.

After completing Listening Training, there are additional opportunities to volunteer in a more direct way with people who need extra care (like ride-sharing, going to activities together, and serving in community mediator roles)
