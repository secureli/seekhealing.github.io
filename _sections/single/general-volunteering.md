# <span class="emphasized-header">General Volunteer</span>

We are always looking for volunteers who share our vision to help support our operations.

Right now, we're particularly in need of volunteers who have the following skills:

- accounting (specifically nonprofit or tax accounting)
- web development (proficiency in Python preferred)
- web design (able to create wire frames)
- research & data analysis (a detail oriented person who can stay on top of collecting and organizing weekly, confidential psychometric data from our pilot program participants)
- community manager (someone to help manage relationships (remotely) and triage support issues with connection agents, listeners and seekers. Communities will be managed through Facebook and private messaging)
