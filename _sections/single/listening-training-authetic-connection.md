By completing this training, youâ€™ll be qualified to volunteer in an radically different addiction healing support program called SeekConnection.

The training will span two weekends and cover techniques on how to offer listening and peer-based support to someone healing from opioid addiction. It will also offer you the opportunity to dig deeper into your own emotional blocks and experience transformative growth.

After the training, you'll be a SeekHealing qualified Listener and you'll be paired with someone who's actively healing from an addiction crisis. The subsequent 6-month program will accelerate both of your healing & growth. 
 
The Listener Training is provided by SeekHealing, a 501(c)3 nonprofit dedicated to liberating human beings from opioid addiction relapse. The program is entirely donation based. A donation is not required but greatly appreciated.
