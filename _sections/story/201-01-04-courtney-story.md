# My name is Courtney, and I'm a seeker.

**Age:** 26

**Occupation:** Full-time Mom

**Hardest part of my journey:** Going to prison for seven months. I did things in active addiction that make my soul cringe now.

**How connection helped me heal:** Meeting and learning how to trust others who have been through what I've been through has helped me tremendously. I wouldn't be where I am today without joining an amazing church as well as a relapse prevention group. Building a strong and real relationship with my partner who has also been critical to my success. Knowing my resources and taking advantage of them was a huge step for me to take in my personal growth, and I also fully believe that you can't keep something without giving it away; I help others change every chance I get because if no one had stepped up to help me, God only knows where I'd be today.
