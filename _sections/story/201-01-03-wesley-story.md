# My name is Wesley, and I'm a seeker.

**Age:** 33

**Occupation:** Ibogaine-Assisted Detox Therapy Provider

**Hardest part of my journey:** Learning to live in a world best described by tears.

**How connection helped me heal:** I chose a new family for myself, I think it's important we have a passion and a reason to wake up in the morning. Iboga offered me that and I ended up doing something where I was supported by others. I spent a lot of my life isolated, and I had to find people who supported me, and who I didn't feel so weird around all the time - and if I was, it would be ok. The people I met through Iboga Life gave me that. They accepted me as I was and loved me and I loved them in return.
