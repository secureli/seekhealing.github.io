# My name is Don, and I'm a seeker.

**Age:** 45

**Occupation:** Landscaping architect

**Hardest part of my journey:** Choosing to be homeless and sleeping outside in the woods for a month rather than continuing in the direction I was going, which would have killed me.

**How connection helped me heal:** Regularly attending NA meetings with people who loved me and challenged me and supported me. Then, I discovered how much it helped me heal and stay sober to talk about journey and help other people, meeting other people in recovery and having hard conversations with them about where they're at. For me it has ben all about meeting and making friends with people who understand what I went though and who don't judge me.
