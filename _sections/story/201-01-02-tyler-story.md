# My name is Tyler, and I'm a seeker.

**Age:** 31

**Occupation:** Small Busines Owner

**Hardest part of my journey:** The physical pain I had to manage only to realize that the pain management method a doctor prescribed me was worsening my overall health.

**How connection helped me heal:** Teaching myself and becoming passionate about how to cultivate plants and tend to a garden. Taking care of a plant that has complex needs and being responsible for its life. Feeling that sense of belonging & purpose by literally getting my hands dirty and learning how to feel what a growing thing needs in order to survive.
