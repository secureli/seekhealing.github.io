# My name is Michael, and I'm a seeker.

**Age:** 29

**Occupation:** Judicial Law Clerk

**Hardest part of my journey:** The crushing feeling of loneliness. I had this feeling that life was a zero-sum game, and it was me against everyone else - always trying to get one over on them. It wore on me more than anything else.

**How connection helped me heal:** Once I found a community of people like me; people who thought like me, who felt like me, who I could relate with; it started to get easier. For me it was awesome sober people who are diehard fans of touring jam-bands like Phish. I met people who were just like me who had found their way into recovery, and I identified with them. It made me feel like it was possible for me too.
