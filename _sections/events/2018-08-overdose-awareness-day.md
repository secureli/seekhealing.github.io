Every year, we lose thousands of lives to drug overdose across the globe, and hundreds right here in Buncombe County. International Overdose Awareness day is an annual event aimed at honoring those lost, as well as a call to action. Join your local Asheville community on August 31st as we recognize the devastating impact of the opioid epidemic and learn about services that are available to help put an end to this crisis.
