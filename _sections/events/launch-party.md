Join us on Saturday May 6th, 2017 at 4pm for our first public fundraising event: come dance, donate, and connect! We'll be hanging out at at the Lost Society in Washington D.C. and live-launching a fundraising campaign to reconnect those who have lost themselves or others to opioid & heroin addiction.
